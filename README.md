This repository contains a simple Python function that demonstrates an unhandled ZeroDivisionError. The `bug.py` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.py` shows the corrected version with error handling.  The error occurs when the function is called with a value of 0 for the divisor 'a'. The solution implements error handling to prevent the crash and return a more meaningful result.
